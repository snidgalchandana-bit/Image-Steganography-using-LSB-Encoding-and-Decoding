# Image-Steganography-using-LSB-Encoding-and-Decoding
The Image Steganography project implements a technique to hide secret information inside a BMP image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. In this method, the least significant bits of pixel values are modified to embed data without visibly changing the image quality.
